<h6>After All </h6>
<p>
It's been one of those days thinking about how far I've come
But it's not about how far I've come, but how much further I have to go 
I've dreamed years away, I've still got more dues to pay 
But isn't the way it always goes?
</p>

<p>
Success is no standard that any others can deem 
It's only what you make it, if you know what I mean 
And for this, I've succeeded through all the years that I've lived 
Cause it's all been heart and soul
In all I created and all I give 
After all
</p>

<p>
After all, just look at what has come and gone
After all, there's still so much left undone 
After all, there's still so much left to be sung 
And after all, just look at what’s begun
And what's begun…
</p>

<p>
those trials and tribulations, that's been the name of the game
But the payoff is far greater than the years of the struggle, the hurt and pain
Any dream is worth living, so how far are you gonna compromise? 
You can't give up cause the difference might lie in one last good try 
</p>

<h6>Deep Waters</h6>

<p>
I set sail a year ago to deep waters 
Set a course unto the waves of the sea
But I keep drifting back, to memories and old faces 
Missed chances and lost places
Was this all I was meant to have?
</p>

<p>
Oh the waves keep crashing all around me 
They turn my view of hope into a haze
But I know the calm will set, even though it hasn’t yet
Well I must believe, I’m not alone in this world
</p>

<p>
Life can be a mystery
Even when the answers are right before your eyes to see
And time just fades to history 
And in the end our memories are all we have 
Are all we have
</p>

<p>
The currents of our lives can lead us to shallow waters
Of shallow hearts and minds with no direction
It’s our only chance to live, so live it well 
And live long 
And set sail to the waters, wade in troubled waters 
But find your course, to the way that sees you home
</p>

<p>
Life can be a mystery
Even when the answers are right before your eyes to see
</p>

<h6>Just One Look </h6>

<p>
If you had just one look of truth and love eternal 
Or one fleeting glance of the innocence we've forgotten
If you could feel the breath of all life as it combines us 
Under the stars, the moon, the heavens and waters 
For we are all the same, yet with those defining differences 
For we are one, for we are brothers
For we are all the same, yet with those defining differences 
For we are one, we are brothers
For we are one, we are brothers
</p>

<h6>Waiting</h6>

<p>
I remember as a child, waiting to become a man
Now I’m waiting for the innocence, as a child I use to have
I’ve been waiting to shed my old skin
I’m still waiting for a chance to change the state I’m in
</p>

<p>
I’ve been waiting for a change, I’ve been waiting for relief 
I’ve been waiting for so long, I don’t know what to believe
I’ve been waiting all my life, I’ve been waiting through the years
I’m just waiting for the wait to be over
</p>

<p>
I’ve been waiting for an idea, and the right choice of words
I’ve been waiting for a chance to get a higher purpose served
I’ve been waiting for redemption, I’ve been waiting to be saved
I’ve been waiting for the strength just to wait another day
</p>

<p>
I’ve been waiting for a change, I’ve been waiting for relief 
I’ve been waiting for so long, I don’t know what to believe
I’ve been waiting all my life, I’ve been waiting through the years
I’m just waiting for the wait to be over
</p>

<p>
I’ve paid my dues and now I’m waiting for a break
 I've been waiting for so long, I missed my chance much too late
Oh I’ve waiting till my fingers are callused to the bone
I’m still waiting to make a difference in this world I’ve come to know
</p>

<p>
I’ve been waiting for a change, I’ve been waiting for relief 
I’ve been waiting for so long, I don’t know what to believe
I’ve been waiting all my life, I’ve been waiting through the years
I’m just waiting for the wait to be over
</p>
