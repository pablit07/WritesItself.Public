	Cheesecake is my favorite type of cake, and subsequently, my favorite type of cheese.
	If there were any way to condesnse cheesecake into a monetary system, I would vote in favor of it.
	Our entire system of economic value should be based on cheesecake. I believe that within the depths of
	my soul and the pit of my stomach. But fuck Cheesecake factory.
