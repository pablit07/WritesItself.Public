<h4>About Writes Itself</h4>

<p>      

      Writes Itself, the original trio from Colorado's front range, is known for their songwriting, aptitude for improvisation, and a unique entrepreneurial spirit: the drive to create a movement that puts people before profit and paves the way for our community to get inspired, be proactive and be given a voice in a song that will collectively write itself. These musicians have set out to fiercely hurdle over the bar into the musical unknown, untamed and unscripted. The music that writes itself is fueled by ingredients of conviction and passion that you haven’t heard from any other band.

All the members of Writes Itself share the same understanding that in music there is no right or wrong, simply a pallet of colors and sounds that evoke both the harmony and dissonance that makes our lives! Our story is that of hope, the struggle, the highs and lows, social and internal commentary, and most importantly a persuasion to live for the real, and leave the rest behind. We are humbled musicians playing for the love of it, the joy of it, for the very heart and soul of it all. Music is the one universal language. From the perspective of our ancestors, music was healing the sick, teaching the young, and tending to the matters of the soul. Despite that, today’s profit driven music industry manufactures and capitalizes on pre-packaged formulas, recycled gimmicks, and exploitations of the trends and fads of the day. Does the industry's obsession to wade in shallow waters create the soundtrack of our lives?

	Writes Itself is part of a movement that sends the message to the music industry that true profit comes from the depth of which every listener's cup is filled, every heart is shaken, every mind is challenged, and every ear gets a solid prescription of soul music. This is the foundation of people before profit. Simply put, Writes Itself wants both live performances and recordings to be as accessible as possible for the listener through the duration of our career (free being ideal!). We would rather that you are able to experience the music than be prohibited by the price of admission. We understand that we are part of a worldwide choir of proactive individuals so eagerly trying to be heard: a community ready to put people before profit and live for a better story to write itself.
